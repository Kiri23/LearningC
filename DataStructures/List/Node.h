/*
 The Node struct is the foundation for list objects, functioning like a single cell in the list.
 Nodes utilize void pointers to store data, and as such are capable of storing any data type.

 Typically, nodes should not be manually instantiated.
 Usage is typically handled by the various list objects.

 In order to work, this requires the data to be allocated on the heap prior to being inserted into a node object.
 Typically, this is handled automatically when the node constructor is used;
 however, custom data types (those not included in the enumeration) need to be allocated manually and the data type Special should be used.

 In order to destroy a node, the node destructor is recommended as it will free both the stored data and the node itself automatically.
