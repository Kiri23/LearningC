# Learning C Programming

This repository documents my journey in learning the C programming language. It contains various projects and exercises that showcase my progress and understanding of C concepts.

## Learning Path

1. **C Syntax Fundamentals**
   - Variables and data types (int, string, array)
   - Pointers
   - Control structures

2. **File I/O**
   - Reading and writing files
   - Bit manipulation in files

3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Networking
   - Threading
   - Data Structures in C (trees, dictionaries, linked lists, queues)
   - Static library creation
   - Object-Oriented Programming principles in C

This learning path follows two main resources:

- [Low Level Academy](https://lowlevel.academy) courses on File Manipulation, Networking, and Threading
- [Web Server Development Playlist](https://youtu.be/dE9jmb7p0Yc?si=m130LJ7gIdjccIkQ) by Eric O Meehan on YouTube

These resources provide a structured approach to learning advanced C programming concepts and system-level development.

## Key Projects
### 1. Database in File
[View Project](./finalproject/README.md)

This file-based database system simulates SQLite functionality:
- Creation of new database files
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Command-line interface for database interactions

This project demonstrates file manipulation, data structures, and CLI design in C.

### 2. Web Server (In Progress)
Building a web server from scratch, similar to Flask or Express.js:
- Implementing routing capabilities
- Template rendering
- Database integration
- Exploring networking concepts in C
- Implementing multi-threading for concurrent connections

### 3. Assembly Programming (Upcoming)
Following the Low Level Academy curriculum to dive into assembly language programming.

## Sparked Interests

This journey has ignited curiosity in various areas:
- Microcontrollers and embedded systems (e.g., STM32 Nucleo board)
- [Bare metal programming](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW7HaCrRydOnxcy8QmW0SNdQ&si=CA1vNJzEHFMnzy35)
- Modern systems programming languages (Rust, Zig)
- Hardware hacking tools (Flipper Zero)
- Microchip architecture and design

## Future Goals

My ultimate objective is to combine the custom web server with the database system to create a full-stack C application. This will involve:

- Defining routes (similar to Express.js or Flask)
- Rendering templates
- Implementing database search and storage functionalities

## For Potential Collaborators and Recruiters

This project showcases my dedication to low-level programming and my ability to build complex systems from the ground up. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing opportunities related to C programming, systems development, or database design, please feel free to reach out.
